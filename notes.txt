when client connects to server, server sends client an id


game proper:

game begins, initial value of code == pass
player enters card to be passed
inside client, data to be forwarded to server will be 
concat code+player_id+card then send to server

example: P1AH

server side:

server receives code, gets first character of code from client

--------------------
if completed num of players
s: send board to clients
c: input card to be passed
s: send "123 pass!"
c: press enter, send to server, (initial action: pass)
s: check action, if P, turn cards, send updated board to clients, repeat until action is F
s: if action is F, send notice to other clients ("tap now")
c: type T or enter to tap
s: check last client to tap, send results to client


if message != quit

elif message != fin and message != tap:

AD

2  3  1
p1 p2 p3
p3 p1 p2

MGA KAILANGAN PANG  GAWIN:

> ayusin yung menu sa client_temp. (how to play)

> may error pa sa pag pass ng cards, di naghihintayan

> printing of board every after turn

> end game detection, F and T options
