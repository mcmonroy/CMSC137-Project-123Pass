when client connects to server, server sends client an id


game proper:

game begins, initial value of code == pass
player enters card to be passed
inside client, data to be forwarded to server will be 
concat code+player_id+card then send to server

example: P1AH

server side:

server receives code, gets first character of code from client

--------------------
if completed num of players
s: send board to clients
c: input card to be passed
s: send "123 pass!"
c: press enter, send to server, (initial action: pass)
s: check action, if P, turn cards, send updated board to clients, repeat until action is F
s: if action is F, send notice to other clients ("tap now")
c: type T or enter to tap
s: check last client to tap, send results to client


if message != quit

elif message != fin and message != tap:

AD

2  3  1
p1 p2 p3
p3 p1 p2

> ayusin yung menu sa client_temp. (how to play)

> may error pa sa pag pass ng cards, di naghihintayan

> printing of board every after turn

MGA KAILANGAN PANG GAWIN (v2):

> end game detection, F and T options (di pa nanonotify yung ibang players na may nakatapos na)

> magulo pa yung synchronization ng send at receive ng data (pero hinihintay na pag magpapass ng card)
	may cases pa na naghihintay si client ng data pero wala namang isesend si server (blank screen)

> data flow diagram

> maayos na pag close ni server
